      <p>
        I've thought a lot about what kind of habits I need to cultivate to be
        my most happy and productive self. For many years, I tried every
        self-help micro-habits stuff I could find in books, blogs, and podcasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see these self-imposed guidelines as a positive constraint, a mental
        framework to help me make better decisions. It is a simple concept but I
        often fail to follow some of these rules. Why is this so hard? Because
        our human nature is not well adapted for the current times. We don't
        have a rational relationship with sweet food, porn, and video games.
        They provide an easy fix to our most intense cravings. They are
        addictive by design. We have to consciously opt-out if we don't want to
        suffer the negative consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remembering a lot of self-imposed rules can be daunting. You then need
        yet another app or a complicated managing system to keep track of all of
        them. I spent a lot of time refining my habits: kicking out what didn't
        work and simplifying what did. I wanted to find the core principles that
        would encompass all the rest. I ended up realizing that a shortlist of
        actions was enough to help me in most situations. This way, writing them
        in a note file works just fine. Here are the simple guidelines I try to
        live by to stay physically and mentally fit:
