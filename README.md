# Personal website

## Tech choices

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - For this kind of website, static generation at build time is the most effective (good SEO out of the box, easy hosting, etc.). Having used Gatsby [before](https://github.com/alexbensimon/maman), I wanted to try Next's new static generation system.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For comfort.
- [Styled JSX](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) - Good opportunity to try it.
